# Lunars Landing Page

Lunars is an NFT community looking to grow the lore of charactaers based on the animals from the Chinese Zodiac.

## Overview

This will serve a landing page for the Lunars community to share and grow our presence. It can be a good way to introduce Lunars - characters, themes, inspiration, and outlook/roadmap for the future.

We can even educate visitors about Cardano and how the blockchain works. How Cardano is unique compared to other blockchains.

## Goals

- Create a mobile responsive website
- Connect to a live ADA/USD chart

### Features

For now we can just use this as a basic landing page that will introduce Lunars and Cardano to newcomers, link people to our discord community, and share our socials.

### Contributing

Any requests are welcome and any recommendations are encourage. We want to continue to build something for the community by the community.
